Collection of scripts that I find enhance my Command Line Experience (r)

 aliases.sh				Simple aliases to make the shell more friendly
 build_histogram.py			Minimal library to produce histogram data
 extract_invalid_emails.py		Given a file as an argument or STDIN, print only bad email addresses
 generate_email_chunk.sh		Used to concatenate email segments and seed lists (probably only useful to me)
 json2csv.py:				Extract keys from newline seperated JSON dictionaries to CSV output
 json2email_distribution.sh		Given a JSON with an 'email' field, find the top domains and counts
 senderscore.sh:			Log to CSV the SMTP sender scores for blocks of IPs
 subtract.sh:				Subtracts patterns in file from a file (alias for grep basically)
